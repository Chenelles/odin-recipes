      <h2>Let's talk about gnocchi</h2>
      <p>The simplest way to think about gnocchi is like a type of 
        pasta - they're usually found near each other in the grocery 
        store - in that it's typically served with any manner of sauce. 
        Once boiled or simmered, they transform into soft little dumpling 
        pillows with an almost cloudlike texture.</p>
      <p>In sum: they're sublime - and definitely worth preparing!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Pounds of golden potatoes</li>
            <li>3 Ounces of fresh spinach (can also use frozen), 
                for the fresh spinach it ends up being about 4 tightly 
                packed cups of spinach</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon of salt (optional)</li>
            <li>1 1/4 Cups of all purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 400 degree F. Using a fork, pierce the potatoes 
                all around and place on a foil lined baking sheet. 
                Bake for 50-60 minutes or until the potatoes are very tender in the center.</li>
            <li>Once out of the oven, let the potatoes cool until you can handle them. 
                Scoop the potatoes out of the skins and place into a potato ricer. If 
                you don't have a ricer, then mash the potatoes with a fork until well 
                combined and broken down. Let sit to cool.</li>
            <li>In a medium pot, boil water. Place the spinach into boil for 3 minutes. 
                Drain and place the spinach in a food processor or high speed blender and 
                blend until pureed. If needed, add a splash of water in to help the spinach blend.</li>
            <li>Once the potatoes are completely cooled, pour half of the pureed spinach onto the riced potatoes. 
                Pour the flour and all of the salt on top of the spinach. Using a fork or your hands, mix 
                it all together. Add in a bit more spinach, a few tablespoons at a time, until 
                it is all added. The finished dough should resemble cookie dough that's just 
                slightly sticky but easy to handle. If it's too sticky, add a bit more flour.</li>
            <li>Once fully combined, roll the dough into a ball and cut it into 8 even pieces. 
                Roll each piece into a long log that's about 1/2 an inch thick. ut the gnocchi into 
                1 inch pieces. Gently toss each piece into flour to ensure that it's dry and not sticky 
                at any edges. Continue until you've cut out pieces from all of the dough.</li>
            <li>Optional: using a gnocchi board or fork, press grooves into each piece of gnocchi.</li>
            <li>The gnocchi can be stored in the fridge for days, the freeze for a few weeks, or 
                cooked right away.</li>
        </ol>
            <h4>To cook the gnocchi:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a pot of salted water to a boil. Add in the gnocchi and let cook 
                    for a couple minutes. Once the gnocchi floats to the surface of the water, 
                    let it boil for 30 more seconds and then remove it from the water using 
                    a slotted spoon.</li>
                <li>Toss in your favorite sauce and ENJOY! For spinach gnocchi, simple 
                    tomato sauce will be an excellent choice, all sprinkled with a bit of parmesan 
                    cheese.</li>
            </ol>
